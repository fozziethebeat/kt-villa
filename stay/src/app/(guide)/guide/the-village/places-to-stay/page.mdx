# Places to Stay

KT Villa is one key place to stay if you have a group of 5 or fewer people.
But maybe you want a hotel or a pension.  Here's a little bit of what I know.

## Hotels

There's a lot of places that say they're a hotel, but they're more like
Pensions.  So here's what I kinda know about hotels:

1. [Green Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YrBvf6LD1Ncx1nH29), a part of Cortina.  Far from everything except Cortina.
1. [Hakuba Highland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PKA63fqYX7QB4Vde6), very nice and great views.
1. [Tokyu Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qWAa9FjcMDo4bghb7), Looks very fancy.

## Areas with Pensions

There's pensions and small lodges literally everywhere.  Some prime spots are:

1. Happo One Area, very central and you can live without a car.
1. Echoland Area, also very central and you can mostly live without a car
   pending your food needs.
1. Goryu Area, you probably need a car as you're ontop of a bit of a hill and
   not much services around beyond Goryu Escal Plaza.
