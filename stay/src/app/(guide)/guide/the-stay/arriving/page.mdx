# Arriving

Once you arrive, you'll need to get the keys and warm up the house.

## The Keys and Doors

On the primary front facing door, there is a big wood shelf on top of the
stairs.  Attached to the shelf is a key lock box.  Enter the code (given by
Keith) and you'll find two sets of door keys.  That gets you inside.

Additionally, in the garage there will be a garage door opener.  This is found
near the door itself on top of a tiny breadbox.  You can use this to enter in
through the garage.

## Getting the car started

Depending on when in the season you arrive, the car may not start.  Find this
car charger (should be on a bookshelf) and jump start it.  The thing has
instructions.  If unsure of what to do, lookup a youtube video on how to jump
start a car with a mobile starter.  Short story is to match the colored hooks
with the plastic covers on the car battery.

## Warming up the house

By default when no one is in the house for a few days, we turn off a few
things:

* The heater
* The water heater
* The water pump

You'll need to turn these on and wait a bit to get cozy in the house.

This is the basic heating system.  Turn on all three buttons to activate the
gas heating.  You can leave the temperature setting where it is.  In fact,
don't change it.

Don't set the thermostat to 6.  It seems to not work.

Additionally you'll need to turn on one or more of the box heaters to actually
heat the house.  Those look like:

The primary room heaters are these ancient looking brown boxes.  On each box,
set the fan strength and heat level independently.

This is the general water pump system.  I kinda forget exactly what it does but
turn it on.

Finally, this is the water heater so you can enjoy warm showers.  You'll want
this to be on.  It is a standard Japanese water heating system.
