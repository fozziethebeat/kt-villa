# Important Services

In Hakuba, you'll probably want to know where a few key services are.  Here's a
few of them.

## Car Rental

Not a lot of options directly in Hakuba:

1. [Windy](https://www.windy-kobeya.com/car-rental/)
2. [NicoNico](https://www.2525r.com/nagano/kitaazumigunhakuba/store-01453-001.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=maps)

In Nagano City, there's a lot around the station, very easy to find and book.

## Places to buy food

### Groceries 

For groceries, you have three:

1. [A-Coop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MYDsZnZ2yCmtXPp6A), my personal favorite.
1. [Delicia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9kGSxBVKcVMcMTvE9), a good backup.
1. [Aeon Big](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GV8xb2Sh7AK7TwodA), not my favorite.

There's also two Lawson Stations and two 7-11s when you're in a pinch.  They're
all on the two major roads.

### Restaurants

There's two major spots for food:

1. Echoland
2. Happo One
