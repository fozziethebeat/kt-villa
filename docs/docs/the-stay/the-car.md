# Using the car

You should find the car parked in the garage.  It's a nice simple hybrid car
that takes regular gas.  It has a Japanese navigation system and comes with the
minimal form of car insurance.  You're welcome to use it to drive around the
village and nearby towns but if you need to take longer trips on a highway,
please rent a car from a nearby shop (ニコニコ is close and offers cars for a
decent price).

You can find the keys to the car in the key box in the living room.  You can
find the garage door opener in the car itself (center box).  Also in the car
are typically tickets for the toll booth to Nagano.

## Getting home with the Navi

If you don't read Japanese, this thing can be pretty confusing.  Here is a step
by step set of photos of how to get home regardless of where you are.  You
might not understand the spoken instructions but the visual guidance will help.
