# Departing

As you leave, please tidy up the house a little bit and shut down everything
that was turned on when you arrived.  This will ensure the house does not run
into any problems when it's cold without anyone staying there.

## Cleaning up

Before leaving, please do some amount of tidying up.  As best you can please:

* Vacuum the floor lightly
* Gather any bedsheets.  Wash them if you can
* Take out the trash
* Put everything back in place

The vacuum is generally in the living room.  It kind of sucks so do your best
to clean up anything obviously problematic.  If needed, general cleaning
supplies are under the kitchen sink, you'll find sprays and towels of various
kinds.

If time permits, use the washing machine to refresh the bedding for future
guests.  I can't guarantee when I'll be around to do so.  The washing machine
can wash and dry one set in about 3 to 4 hours.  There's also a coin laundry
next to Aeon that'll wash everything in an hour.

The coin laundry (useful even before you leave for anyhting).

Hit the blue buttons to turn on an auto wash and dry cycle and it'll do
everything but fold the contents.

Finally, trash.  All trash needs to be taken to the Green Valley Hakuba drop off center

This is just down the road from the house.  The simplest way to handle trash is:
* Bring the bottles and sort them into the right bins at the center
* Bring the plastics from the trash bin in the polymer bag as is
* Put the burnable trash in an additional trash bag and bring it

Finally, put in fresh polymer bags into the burnable and plastics bin.  These
can all be found under the microwave.

## Turning down the house

This is essentially the opposite of [warming up the
house](/docs/the-stay/arriving#warming-up-the-house):

* The water heater
* The water pump
* The heater

:::warning[Heater Boxes and AC]

Make sure you turn the A/C on the second floor off and all the individual brown
heater boxes off all the way.

:::

When you leave these should each look like the following.

The water heater is pretty intuitive, just hit the off button.

Last but not least, make sure the garage door key is in the garage and the
house keys are back in the lock box and it's secure.
