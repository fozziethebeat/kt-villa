# Arriving

Once you arrive, you'll need to get the keys and warm up the house

## The Keys and Doors

On the primary front facing door, there is a big wood shelf ontop of the
stairs.  Attached to the shelf is a keylock box.  Enter the code (given by
Keith) and you'll find two sets of door keys.  That gets you inside.

Additionally, in the garage there is a garage door opener.  This is found
nearly the door itself ontop of a breadbox.  You can use this to enter in and
out of the garage.

## Warming up the house

By default when no one is out of the house for a few days, we turn off a few
things:

* The heater
* The water heater
* The water pump

You'll need to turn these on and wait a bit to prepare the house.

This is the basic heating system.  Turn on all three buttons to run activate
the gas heating.  You can leave the temperature setting where it is.  In fact,
don't change it.

Don't set the thermostat to 6.  It seems to not work.

Additionally you'll need to turn on one or more of the box heaters to actually
heat the house.  Those look like:

The primary room heater are these ancient looking brown boxes.  Turn on each
fan strength and heat level independently.

This is the general water pump system.  I kinda forget exactly what it does but
turn it on.

Finally, this is the water heater so you can enjoy warm showers.  You'll want
this to be on.  its a standard Japanese water heating system.
