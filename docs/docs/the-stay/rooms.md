# Rooms and Ameneties

The house has rooms! and things! You can use the rooms and the things.  Please
treat them with the campfire rule, leave things better than you found them.

## The Rooms

We have a total of three bedrooms:
* A 1F tatami room
* A 1F bedroom (this is Keith's room and not for use unless explicitly approved)
* A 2F office guest room

:::danger[Don't lock bedroom doors]

We lost the keys to the bedrooms.  So don't lock them otherwise someone might need to pick the lock or drill the lock and crack it.  We'll be fixing this soon-ish.

### Tatami Room

This is the primary room for all guests.  It should fit three with futon and
bedding for everyone.  All bedding is in the closet.  It also has a standing
desk for use.

### The Office Room

This is the second room for guests.  It has two standing desks, a spare
bathroom, and a sofa bed.  There's also a big closet you can use and bedding.

### Keith and Tianyi's Room

This is on the first floor near the washing machine.  Unless Keith or Tianyi
say so, please stay out of this room.  Keith may randomly be arriving and be
staying here.

### The Bathrooms

The primary wash room is on the first floor near the washing machine.  Please
use as needed to keep yourselve clean.

And of course shower.

Lastly, the primary toilet room is right next to the shower room.

## The Amenities 

The most important are of course the kitchen.  Please use as desired and put
all dishware back where they are found.

![The Espresso Machine](/img/IMG_4004.png)

And please use the espresso machine with any beans you've brought.  Youtube has
lots of videos on how to use this if you haven't used one before.  It's fun.

![The Advanced Projector](/img/IMG_4023.png)

We have a very advanced projector.  The living room roll curtain can be used as
a screen.  Move the projected to whatever position works and plug your laptop
in to watch a movie or two.

![The driveway](/img/IMG_4011.png)

And of course we have a driveweay.  Don't park too close to the garage door
since snow falls off the roof.  You don't want that on your roof.  Generally
the safe place is behind the line created by the metal stairs.  This generally
gets you two cars.

Lastly, you may need to clean the yard if snow is heavy.  We have a small snow blower in front of the garage.  The key is near the garage door opener.

This thing is basically a tiny motor engine.  If it doesn't start when you turn
the key you might need to jump start it.  There's a big handle and a pull
string near the gas tank to do so.  Good luck.
