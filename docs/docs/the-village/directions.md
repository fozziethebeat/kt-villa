# Directions

There's a few options for making your way to Hakuba Village, depending on the
transportation you prefer:
* Train
* Mix of Train and Bus
* Driving

## Train

There's two routes to Hakuba purely by train, both take a while but have nice
scenic options.

### Through Matsumoto

From Shinjuku station there's an express train that goes straight to Matsumoto
and then onwards to Hakuba.  If you take the Azusa Express it'll go directly to
Hakuba in about 4 hours with some nice views.  Granted, this train leaves at 8am.

You can also take an express to Matsuomoto and take a small local detour before
getting back on a train to Hakuba.  This second option does take longer but
gives you a chance to see Matsumoto Castle and maybe get a beer at Matsuomoto
brewery.  This route has more time options.

The route should look something like

### Through Itoigawa

Another option is to take the Shinkansen to Itoigawa and transfer over to the
line that goes through Otari and onwards to Hakuba.  This also takes a while
but the one-car train from Itoigawa to Otari is quite cute with nice mountain
views.  Itoigawa itself is pretty boring.

## Train and Bus

The most common route is to take a train directly to Nagano station and then a
shuttle bus to Hakuba.  Its cost effective and usually pretty fast.  It's also
what Google maps always recommends

## By Car

I've found two good routes to Hakuba via car.  Both are good and give you
different views and unique service area stops.  You can either go through
Nagano city or Matsumoto city and then take local roads to Hakuba.

### Via Nagano

This route usually avoids traffic as you cut up north and then head west.  One
part to prepare for is a 210å†† toll road that doesn't take ETC, so have cash or
coins handy.  As for stops, Yokogawa is nice.

### Via Matsumoto

This route gives a nice view of Fuji-san.  You can also stop by Suwako which
has a really nice luxurious service area.  There's also a small service area
with really nice bread, but I forget the name.

The route looks like [this](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9XU3JLaADaL16Fpu9) on
Google Maps.
