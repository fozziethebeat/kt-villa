This is a collective project for Tianyi's 36th birthday
(May 19). You make dreams, based on personal stories
you've had with Tianyi, and then I (Keith) will somehow
turn that into a cute booklet for her.

Why dreams and what kind of dreams? Late 2024, Tianyi read the
[Dallergut Dream Department Store](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194036469-dallergut-dream-department-store)
and *absolutely* loved it. So because of that, we're
going to turn our memories with Tianyi into inspiring,
challenging, and probably hilarious dreams. If you
haven't read Dallergut, go read it, it is pretty great
and a very fast read.

To start, Click the "Dream" button and write a brief
personal memory. Try creating dream stories with AI. Once you
have a fun dream version of your memory, turn it into an image
(also with AI). Play around with different styles until you
are satisfied and then save. Keith will do the rest.
